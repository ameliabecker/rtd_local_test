nav to readthedocs.org folder

.. code-block:: language

	CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include/libxml2 \
	LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib \
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Clone the repository somewhere on your disk and enter to the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org.git`
`cd readthedocs.org`

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Next, install the dependencies using pip (make sure you are inside of the virtual environment):

pip install -r requirements.txt
This may take a while, so go grab a beverage. When it's done, build the database:

python manage.py migrate
Then create a superuser account for Django:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Now let's properly generate the static assets:

python manage.py collectstatic
Now you can optionally load a couple users and test projects:

python manage.py loaddata test_data

python manage.py runserver
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see how it looks; you can use the admin interface via http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin (logging in with the superuser account you just created).
